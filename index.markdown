## README.TXT

Hello World! My name is Yuansun (Sonny) Jiang. I am currently studying for a Masterâ€™s of Science in Quantitative Economics; which is essentially Data Science applied towards Economics. I have experience with programing and was originally taught in Java before transitioning over to Python for more powerful data analytic tools. Over the course of this program, I have used Calculus and Differential Equations to model different types of markets; and statistical methods to determine causation. I hope to create this website to archive what I have learned not only in my studies, but also some of my personal interests.
